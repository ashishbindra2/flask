create a database for your project:

    CREATE DATABASE flask_db;

Note: Every Postgres statement must end with a semi-colon, so make sure that your command ends with one if you are experiencing issues.

Next, create a database user for our project. Make sure to select a secure password:

    CREATE USER sammy WITH PASSWORD 'password';

Then give this new user access to administer your new database:

    GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE flask_db TO sammy;

To confirm the database was created, get the list of databases by typing the following command:

    \l

Youâ€™ll see flask_db in the list of databases.
